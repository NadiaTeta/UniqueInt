# Sparse Matrix Operations

This project implements basic operations (addition, subtraction, multiplication) on sparse matrices using a custom data structure in Python.
## Running the Code

1. **Navigate to the code directory:**

    ```bash
    cd /dsa/sparse_matrix/code/src/
    ```

2. **Run the script:**

    ```bash
    python3 sparse_matrix.py
    ```

3. **Follow the prompts:**

    - Enter the path to the first matrix file (e.g., `/dsa/sparse_matrix/sample_inputs/easy_sample_01_1.txt`).
    - Enter the path to the second matrix file (e.g., `/dsa/sparse_matrix/sample_inputs/easy_sample_01_2.txt`).
    - Select the matrix operation (1 for addition, 2 for subtraction, 3 for multiplication).

4. **View the results:**
    - The results will be printed to the console in the format `(row, col, value)`.
